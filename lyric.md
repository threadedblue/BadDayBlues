First thing in the morning
I don't feel right
First thing in the morning
Up from the night
I am getting the news 
I keep getting the news

I got the bad day blues

I let the blues run all over me
I could not put up a fight
I let the blues run all around me
I never said it was not right
I let the blues run right through me
They hissed be did not bite


G-d is in His heaven and nothing escapes Him. 
Feel the blues let them permeate you 
G-d is in His heaven and has his hand on you
Dance the dance of the forsaken.
Sing the song so blue.
Dance and sing on the open palm 
Step through the shadows the fingers cast. 
He has His hold on you.
