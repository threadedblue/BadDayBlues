First thing in the morning
I don't feel right
First thing in the morning
Coming up from the night
First thing in the morning
Don't show me that early light

Sat there in my solitude
I got me the bad day blues

I let the blues run all over me
I could not put up a fight
I let the blues run all around me
I never complained that it was not right
I let the blues run right through me
I noticed they never did bite

Sat there in my solitude
I got me the bad day blues

G-d is in His heaven and nothing misses His eye
G-d is in His heaven and nothing misses His eye
He keeps His hold on me and the bad day rolls on by

I stand on a holy floor and looks like bars all around
I stand on a holy floor and looks like bars all around


Feel the blues let them permeate you 
G-d is in His heaven and has his hand on you
Dance the dance of the forsaken.
Sing the song so blue.
Dance and sing on the open palm 
Step through the shadows the fingers cast. 
He has His hold on you.
