First thing in the morning
I don't feel right.  
I am down.  
First thing in the morning
The morning light in bright.
First thing in the morning
I am just up from the night.
Woke up so sad?  
The whole thing is bad.
Let me give you the news.
I got the bad day blues. 

G-d is in His heaven and nothing escapes Him. 
Feel the blues let them permeate you 
G-d is in His heaven and has his hand on you
Dance the dance of the forsaken.
Sing the song so blue.
Dance and sing on the open palm 
Step through the shadows the fingers cast. 
He has His hold on you.
